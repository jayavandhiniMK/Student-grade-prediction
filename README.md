# Student Academic Grade Prediction
## Project Overview
This project predicts a student’s *semester performance* using basic academic parameters.  
A *Linear Regression* model is used to estimate semester marks based on internal marks, attendance percentage, and assignment scores.
The project demonstrates a complete *Basic Machine Learning workflow*, suitable for academic evaluation and beginner ML practice.
Student Grade Prediction Project
Project Overview

This project predicts the semester marks and grades of students based on key performance indicators such as internal marks, attendance percentage, and assignment scores. It uses Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning technique, to model and predict student performance.

This project can help educators and students identify expected academic outcomes and take proactive measures to improve performance.

## Features
Predict semester marks based on student data.
Predict grades based on predicted marks.
Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.
Visualize actual vs predicted marks using a scatter plot.
Predict marks and grades for new students.
## Dataset
The dataset is *self-created* and stored as a CSV file.
### Features:
- internal_marks – Internal assessment marks
- attendance_percentage – Attendance percentage
- assignment_score – Assignment / lab scores
### Target:
- semester_marks – Final semester marks
> Synthetic data is used to avoid privacy concerns related to real student data.
## Machine Learning Approach
- Model Used: *Linear Regression and logistic regression* 
- Learning Type: *Supervised Learning*
- Problem Type: *Regression and classification*
## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*
- *R² Score*
An *Actual vs Predicted Marks* scatter plot is generated to visualize model accuracy.
